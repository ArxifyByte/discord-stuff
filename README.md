# Important
Nothing shown here is against the [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and you don't need to use any client modification.
## 1 - Discord's Color Schemes
Let's start with a new feature, the color schemes. As you can see in the demo, this says 'Staff Only', so probably it's not going to be released anytime soon. If you want to check it out, here's a demo. (sorry for the bad quality & shitty framerate lol)<br>

## 2 - Discord Profile Decorations
I saw these on one of [No Text To Speech](https://youtube.com/notexttospeech)'s videos, and I tried it out. This is only available for Nitro Boost subscribers, so I couldn't try it at all because I have a Nitro Basic subscription. Here's a demo.<br>

## 3 - Weird login bug
If you have the Color Schemes feature enabled, go to the 'Appearance' tab on your settings, and press ALT + left arrow key, you'll be taken to a weird bug which seems to be related to Discord's login page. It doesn't actually log you out, but it's fun to try. Here's a demo.<br>

# Extra
For now, that's all. Tomorrow I'll continue searching for beta features and posting them here as I find them. As an update, the [profile slash commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYKt4eX_F6o) are now patched.<br>
Happy hunting!
